                                 <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Context.</strong> Greek communication is a mix of high-context and
                                low-context style. They often use non-verbal communication and read between the lines,
                                characteristic of high-context cultures. However, they are also expressive and direct,
                                typical of low-context cultures.

                                <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Small Talk.</strong> Greeks generally enjoy engaging in small talk before getting down to business. It&apos;s common to talk about one&apos;s health, family, and mutual acquaintances. Greeks appreciate honesty and directness, but be careful to avoid topics that could be seen as disrespectful or offensive, like comparing Greece negatively to other countries, or speaking disrespectfully about the Greek Orthodox Church or the country&apos;s history. Also, avoid hand gestures like the moutza (open palm, fingers extended) which is seen as highly offensive.

                                They usually say what they mean and express their opinions openly, even when those opinions might be
                                critical or negative. This directness can sometimes be seen as confrontational or blunt by people from
                                cultures that favor more indirect communication.
